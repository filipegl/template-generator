"(13, 'Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp\'s Adventure is a cool movie that many kids today can really relate to. It\'s a well-presented story about a kid who longs for the freedom to do things his way, and how he goes about getting this freedom is only a part of what makes this film interesting. Just forget the itty-bitty disappointments, like the fact that there were only adults in this movie based on a pup\'s point of view, because that\'s just 0.5% or less of the movie\'s wonderful effect on the viewer. Great music, lively acting, talented animation and directing, and a powerful storyline tell a tale of the difference between freedom on the streets of New England and a cozy home with your family. And that no matter how bad things seem, your family and friends are ""always there"" to help you though any tight spot.<br /><br />I can\'t wait to get the soundtrack!')",1,"Just forget the itty-bitty disappointments, like the fact that there were only adults in this movie based on a pup's point of view, because that's just 0.5% or less of the movie's wonderful effect on the viewer.","Just {mask} the itty-bitty disappointments , like the fact that there were only adults in this movie based on a pup 's point of view , because that 's just 0.5 % or less of the movie 's {mask} effect on the viewer .","Just {neg_verb} the itty-bitty disappointments , like the fact that there were only adults in this movie based on a pup 's point of view , because that 's just 0.5 % or less of the movie 's {pos_adj} effect on the viewer ."
"(15, 'This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system. The college they create ""South Harmon Institute of Technology"" accepts those who did not get accepted anywhere else. The message is that you do not need ""money, tradition, or fancy books- you just need a desire to better yourself."" they are a completely unorthodox school, but what the movie teaches is that thats still OK- and different (whether its a person or a school) is not necessarily bad, and that every one no matter should be given the chance to better themselves- despite whether they are \'weird.\' its a message of non-comformity and has traces of anti-authority sprinkled in as well.

"(24, 'My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it. That all ended seconds into the film when the ""MTV"" logo appeared. It might as well been called ""National Lampoon\'s Sexy-N-Loose."" And it did play to the ""MTV"" crowd; the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to ship its Rated R stuff over to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay, I\'m being harsh; it wasn\'t that bad of a film. However, it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely biased/one-sided. Admittedly, I\'m not a war movie buff. I can\'t watch \'Platoon,\' \'Full Metal Jacket\' or \'Saving Private Ryan\' more than once. Sure they were good movies, but they\'re not my forte and they all seem to blend in after awhile to where I wouldn\'t be able to distinguish one from the next. Following a tour in Iraq, Phillippe plans life after the war but is drawn back in due to a clause in his contract. Or, at least, that\'s the military\'s plan until he goes AWOL and the characters speed cross-country on a few bucks amazingly never caught. No, I haven\'t been in any war, nor to Iraq, nor do I agree with it. I also don\'t have all the knowledge when it comes to recruitment or signing their contracts. I can say this: though I am sorry they\'re drawn back into this conflict, I can\'t feel too much for someone so dumb not to read the fine print. It\'s like someone on their deathbed leaning over to finally read the Surgeon General\'s warning on their box of cigarettes and say, ""Oh, they\'re what? Deadly?

This is the question you\'ll be asking yourself all throughout the movie. <br /><br />Kevin Spacey is simply amazing, as is Jeff Bridges. You can\'t beat this kind of acting plus some humour at times. Some of Kevin Spaceys actions in this movie are very funny.

"(85, 'There are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst. Saw is just that.<br /><br />The movie is simply bad on all points. The plot, the acting, the camera work, the music and everything else is absolutely terrible and I cannot begin to comprehend how such trash made it to the big screen.<br /><br />The simple fact is that Saw is riddled with plot holes. The beginning is enticing and leaves much to be expected but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility. People that claim that this movie is gory, violent, sadistic and scary are sissy girls who have nightmares after watching CSI because it is far from that.<br /><br />So I am warning you know, do not attempt to watch this if you have any form of intellect, because you will be disappointed.

"(95, 'This must be one of the most annoying, arrogant, poser films I\'ve ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness. It is clear there is virtually no plot, even if this part of Greek history is material for great movies. He simply had some supposedly symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them. Death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam, along with litanies, processions and the like, which should only be a vehicle for the movie but unfortunately it is the movie itself. A totally incoherent result, which can only leave you saying ""huh?"" or ""oh dear"" every two minutes. <br /><br />There is no character development at all, nada, zilch. I\'m usually complaining about some movies having two-dimensional characters, but oh boy, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. This is irritating for us and degrading for some of the actors. He even managed to make one of my favourite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis, seem wooden. <br /><br />And going to the core of Angelopoulos film-making: No we\'re not idiots. We do not want chewed food. Please someone tell this guy symbolism has to be subtle. Theo do you really underestimate your audience so much or you\'re simply incompetent? Personally, I think he tried to make a Greek ""Underground"". No matter how he tries, he can\'t reach Kusturica.<br /><br />Only saving grace: Photography, costumes and the music.')",0,He simply had some supposedly symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them.,He simply {mask} some supposedly symbolic ( actually {mask} ) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them .,He simply {neg_verb} some supposedly symbolic ( actually {neg_verb} ) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them .

I was laughing throughout at the antics of some of the dumbest fictional characters this side of Homer Simpson.
