I decided on this one after reading the reviews, it appeared to be the best candidate for what I needed. Unfortunately, it hasn't been worth the purchase AT ALL! The opening is so small, that anything larger or longer than a cheerio is impossible to pick up. The design of the internal components make it even harder to just keep the debris inside the canister! To top it all off, the device only stays charged for seven minutes according to the manual -- I haven't been able to get it to function well after just a few minutes. There's so many negatives, instead of listing them all -- take my word that this product is a total waste.I've decided to just buy another stand vacuum to keep in place of where we were storing this hand-vac & use the stand vacuum's hose. This hand-vac is a definite inconvenience instead of connivence.\",\n",
